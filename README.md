Pressevent
==========

Get notifications for your running wordpress instances, and never miss an
important update again. [Pressevent](http://pressevent.herokuapp.com) is hosted
on heroku.

How?
----
Pressevent will monitor registered wordpress installations for updates and sent
out email reports once a day. Since It's not nice to give away the keys to the
kingdom pressevent works with [WP Updater
API](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-updater-api/) which allows access to just
the information about updates via an API key. It's easily installed and
configured like any other Wordpress Plugin.

Getting started with development
--------------------------------
Install all the dependencies via bundler first

    $ bundle install

Setup the database (requires postgres to be installed)

    $ createuser --superuser --host=localhost postgres

Create the needed configuration files

    $ cp sample.env .env

Now run the tests via

    $ rake test:all

Everything should work fine, and you can start a development server via

    $ foreman start -f Procfile.development

Deploying
---------
Pressevent runs on heroku, so you just need to create the app with Sendgrid as a
plugin activated, and then

    $ git push heroku master

takes care of deploy. To have the daily report emails sent just setup a cronjob
via Heroku Scheduler to run

    $ rake pressevent:automatic_update_report

Just to be save set a secret token as well

    $ heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=`rake secret`
